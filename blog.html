<h3>Life at Turing</h3>
<h5>March 2nd, 2017</h5>
<br><br>
<p>Turing has been a very challenging yet rewarding experience. I have went from knowing nothing
about writing code to being able to make a database attached to an app in less than 3 months. This
is pretty incredible. Every day I'am confronted with a new challenge that forces me to think outside
the box and outside my comfort zone. This pushes me to always expect the unexpected and to be like water.
This style of thinking really works for me because thats the way I live my life for the most part.
I take challenges as they come. If we make assumptions we will be let down and unprepared. Turing has
made me better and has opened my mind to a new and exciting journey that I have always thought about taking.</p>

<h3>Mod 4 & Open Source</h3>
<h5>June 6th, 2017</h5>
<p>Mod 4 has been a very challenging inning. Trying to find the thing you want to build off of or to start
  something new was one of the things I struggled with the most. That said, the challenges and teamwork that I
  experienced in this mod really helped me drive to the finish line and not lose my resolve. I am very happy with
  my cohort and value everyone's opinion in the group. I feel very happy that I have built some lasting relationships
  that will last a long time.</p>
<p>Open source was one of the assignments we were given. To explore what it is like to work on brownfield projects and
  resolve issues with existing applications. This was pretty challenging for me to complete considering all the things I
  had on my plate. I did my best to participate and learn something new in this regard. I chose to do the faker gem,
  as many others in the cohort did. This to me felt approachable and manageable in the sense that I wanted to complete this
  yet I didnt want to take on something to large and not deliver. You might say my contribution was small but it is only
  the beginning of what I will create in the future.</p>
