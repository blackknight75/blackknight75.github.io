<h3>Life at Turing</h3>
<h5>March 2, 2017</h5>
<br><br>
<p>Turing has been a very challenging yet rewarding experience. I have went from knowing nothing
about writing code to being able to make a database attached to an app in less than 3 months. This
is pretty incredible. Every day I'am confronted with a new challenge that forces me to think outside
the box and outside my comfort zone. This pushes me to always expect the unexpected and to be like water.
This style of thinking really works for me because thats the way I live my life for the most part.
I take challenges as they come. If we make assumptions we will be let down and unprepared. Turing has
made me better and has opened my mind to a new and exciting journey that I have always thought about taking.</p>
